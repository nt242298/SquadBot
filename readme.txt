How to run the code:

After creating a new virtual environment in PyCharm, it is enough to install only these three modules: numpy, nltk, torch.

Make sure you have all the files in the same directory.

Run the model_neural file first, then run the train_model file, and finally run the main module. 

The bot will start in the terminal window.

There is no need to install all the requirements from the requirements.txt file, but we generated this file just in case.
